# Library-Management-System
The project is a student and library management system that uses Python and MySQL. It creates a SchoolLibrary database with two tables: student and library, where the student table stores student details and the library table tracks borrowed books. It validates student_id before adding library records, ensuring data integrity with foreign key constraints. The system can insert student and library data, and it generates a report of overdue books, saving it to a CSV file. It provides error handling for invalid data and ensures smooth user interaction via the command-line interface. The system is portable, scalable, and can be extended with additional features like notifications or book reservations.
